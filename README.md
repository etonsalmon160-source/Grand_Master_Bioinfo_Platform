## 🛠️ Security & Protection

Maintaining the integrity of this platform is our top priority. The following measures are in place:

1. **Branch Protection**: The master code and deployment branch are locked. Direct pushes are disabled to prevent accidental or unauthorized code modification.
2. **Key Isolation**: All infrastructure keys and analytics tokens are stored in secure environment secrets, never exposed in the source code.
3. **Environment Lockdown**: The Streamlit Cloud runtime is isolated. Users cannot access the underlying file system or execute shell commands.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `bioinfo_app.py`: The premium Streamlit UI and frontend logic.
- `master_bioinfo_suite.py`: The analytical engine (WGCNA, ML, DEA).
- `requirements.txt`: Automated environment setup for zero-config deployment.
